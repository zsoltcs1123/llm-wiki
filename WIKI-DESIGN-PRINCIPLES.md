# Wiki Design Principles

Design principles for the LLM Wiki system.

## Purpose

This is not a generic markdown vault. It is a set of focused, compounding knowledge bases for coherent question spaces.

The goal is not to collect everything adjacent to a topic into one place. The goal is to maintain the smallest set of focused wikis that can answer the important questions in each domain well.

## Core Principles

### 1. Strong Center of Gravity per Wiki

A good wiki has a clear conceptual center.

Each wiki should optimize for questions that orbit one coherent domain. Content is in-scope when it materially improves that wiki's ability to answer those questions.

Warning signs that a wiki's center of gravity is getting blurry:

- concept pages become broad and vague
- syntheses stop building on one another cleanly
- the same terms mean different things in different sections
- adjacent domains start dominating the index

### 2. One Wiki per Coherent Question Space

Do not create a new wiki for every narrow topic. Do not force all adjacent domains into one giant wiki either.

Use this rule:

> One wiki per coherent question space.

A separate wiki becomes justified when the new domain develops:

- its own recurring concepts and entities
- its own main questions
- syntheses that mostly depend on its own source set
- only partial overlap with the current wiki's core concepts

### 3. Absorb First, Split Later

Adjacent material should usually be absorbed into an existing wiki first, then split only when a new center of gravity clearly emerges.

This avoids premature fragmentation and duplicate plumbing.

### 4. Split Before the Domain Turns Muddy

Do not wait until a wiki is already incoherent.

Split when a topic starts generating:

- many source pages that rarely link back to the current core concepts
- entity pages that matter mostly in a different domain
- syntheses whose value is mostly independent of the current wiki
- navigation pressure to create a second index in practice

### 5. Role-Based Wiki Root, Author-Nested Sources

Each wiki root is organized by page role:

- `source` (under `wiki/sources/{author}/`)
- `concept`
- `entity`
- `synthesis`

Source pages are grouped by author under `wiki/sources/{author}/`, mirroring `raw/sources/`. Concepts, entities, and syntheses stay at the wiki root by role. Concepts remain the primary navigation hub; author folders aid provenance browsing and ingest alignment with `raw/`.

### 6. Concepts Are the Load-Bearing Layer

Source summaries are necessary, but concept pages are where a wiki starts compounding.

A concept page should exist when:

- the same idea appears in multiple sources
- the idea is used repeatedly in syntheses
- the concept helps compress future reasoning

If there is doubt, prefer creating a concept page earlier rather than later.

### 7. Entities Should Earn Their Page

Not every named thing deserves an entity page.

Create one when the entity:

- appears across multiple sources
- matters analytically, not just referentially
- acts as a stable node for future synthesis

### 8. Query Outputs Should Compound

Useful answers should become wiki artifacts.

If a query produces a durable insight, comparison, framework, or recommendation, it should usually be filed back into `wiki/syntheses/` rather than left in chat history.

### 9. Linting Is Part of Knowledge Work

Wiki maintenance is not cleanup after the real work. It is part of the real work.

Lint passes should look for:

- missing concept pages
- missing entity pages
- stale claims
- weak provenance
- orphan pages
- places where the center of gravity is being diluted

### 10. The Repo Is the Agent's Memory

If something matters to future reasoning, it should live in the repo.

That includes:

- source pages
- concept pages
- entity pages
- syntheses
- index/log history
- design principles like this document

## Boundary Policy

Use three labels mentally when deciding where content belongs:

### Core

Material that directly supports a wiki's main question space.

Keep it in that wiki.

### Adjacent

Material that is not central, but regularly helps answer core questions.

Usually keep it in the current wiki until it grows into its own cluster.

### Separate Domain

Material with its own center of gravity, concepts, entities, and syntheses.

Create a separate wiki when this becomes substantial.

## Meta-Layer Direction

When multiple focused wikis exist, connect them with a thin meta layer rather than merging them into one mega-wiki.

The meta layer should stay lightweight:

- directory of related wikis
- shared conventions
- cross-wiki synthesis pages
- top-level map of major concepts and entities where needed

The meta layer should coordinate focused wikis, not replace them.

## System Shape

This dev repo provides:

- `skills/wiki/` — operate layer (init, ingest, query, lint, discard)
- `_scaffold/` — canonical wiki skeleton
- these design principles and the roadmap

Host repos install skills and create wikis in place. Domain-specific center of gravity stays local to each wiki.

## Working Heuristic

Use this default decision rule:

> Absorb adjacent material while it strengthens the current wiki's center of gravity. Split only when the adjacent material develops a stronger center of gravity of its own.

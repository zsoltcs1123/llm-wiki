# Quick Summarize

## Outcome

Compact summary capturing the essence of any text. Max ~15 lines. Default output in chat. Every line must carry signal.

See [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md) for format.

## Guardrails

- Read full input before writing.
- Never fabricate Source/Author — omit if unknown.
- No filler, no fluff.
- Keep the language focused, clean and well-written. Avoid em dash and typical AI style.
